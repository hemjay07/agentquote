**Opportunity:** Most keywords have zero direct competitors
**Speed:** 2-minute estimate vs. 2-3 weeks for consultants
**Data:** 14 validated formulas from real experiments

**Timeline:** Month 3 = top 20 for key phrases, Month 12 = 3,000-5,000 visits/month

---

## Critical Success Factors

1. **Content Quality > Quantity**
   - Real experimental data > generic benchmarks
   - Specific numbers > vague claims
   - Actionable advice > theoretical

2. **Speed Matters**
   - Implement Phase 1 NOW (this week)
   - Publish Phase 2 content in Week 3-4
   - Don't wait for perfection

3. **Internal Linking**
   - Every page should link to /estimate
   - Blog posts link to relevant model/pattern pages
   - Create a web, not isolated pages

4. **Measurement**
   - Set up Google Search Console from day 1
   - Track organic traffic weekly
   - Identify what's working, double down

5. **Community**
   - Share your methodology (build-in-public)
   - Respond to comments/questions
   - Build trust = backlinks naturally

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Publishing 10 blog posts at once**
→ Better: 1 post/week, optimize based on performance

❌ **Trying to rank for "AI pricing" (head keyword)**
→ Better: "Claude Haiku agent cost" (long-tail)

❌ **Ignoring internal links**
→ Better: Every page has a path to /estimate

❌ **Waiting for perfection before launching**
→ Better: Launch MVP SEO (landing page + 1 blog), iterate

❌ **Not monitoring rankings**
→ Better: Weekly Google Search Console checks

## Roadmap Adjustments

### If You're Short on Time
**Priority order (do these first):**

2. Meta tags + schema
3. First 2 blog posts (80/20 of traffic)
4. Model pages (programmatic, less effort)

Skip for now:
- Pattern pages (can do later)
- Tier 2/3 blog posts (add Month 4+)
- Use-case pages (Phase 2)

### If You Want Aggressive Growth
**Add these:**
1. Guest posting on AI blogs (1-2 posts, Month 2)
2. Backlink outreach (Month 2, ongoing)
3. Twitter thread strategy (#buildinpublic)
4. AI newsletter mentions

### If You Want Conservative Approach
**Focus on:**
1. Slow, steady content publishing
