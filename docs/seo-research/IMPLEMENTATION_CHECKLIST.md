## 🚨 Red Flags (Course Correction Needed)

If you see any of these, adjust strategy:

- **No traffic after month 2** → Check indexing in GSC. Did pages get indexed?
- **High bounce rate (>70%)** → Landing page messaging unclear. Review and rewrite.
- **Keywords not moving** → Content quality may be low. Compare to top-ranking competitors.
- **No backlinks after month 2** → Outreach emails aren't resonating. Personalize more.
- **Steep drop in traffic** → Check for technical issues (site down? indexing problem?)
