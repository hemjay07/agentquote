## Notes on Search Volume

**Caveat:** These search volume estimates are conservative and based on 2026 trends research. Actual volumes may vary by:
- Geographic region (US vs global)
- Seasonal trends (higher during fundraising season)
- Competition (new AI models drive new searches)

**Opportunity:** Most of these keywords have **low competition**. New category. Early mover advantage = rank fast.

---

## Red Flags to Watch

If these keywords suddenly have high competition:
- "ai agent cost estimation" (direct competitor)
- "agent pricing calculator" (direct competitor)
- "how much does ai agent cost" (consultant/benchmark site)

→ Shift strategy to long-tail, differentiation-heavy content

2. **Prioritize:** Focus on "how much" and "reduce cost" keywords first
3. **Create:** Follow content calendar from Month 1
